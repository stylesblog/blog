    <h1> All About Me</h1> 
<h2> Swimming</h2>
<img src="images/swimming.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<p> I am a swimmer and have been for multiple years. Though I do not do competitive swimming, I still have fun and swim frequently. I also have a pool in my backyard for casual swimming during the summer months. I don't really love swimming, but it is a good sport to be in and I find that it is likable. I have been swimming since I was 6, and have come a long way from where I began. 
    <p>Even though I had to move to Texas, I have continued to be a frequent swimmer and have even increased my time per week swimming as the months go by and I gain endurance. Swimming has always been a small hobby of mine, that I can engage in even when I'm down. I don't have to think about anything, I can just swim. This makes it perfect for times when I don't feel like doing anything. Maybe someday I'll get a scholarship for swimming. Who knows? </p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p> Reading is one of my biggest passions as an 8th grader. I love getting lost in books and stories every page. Whenever I have free time, (if I'm not on my phone), I'm always reading a novel. I have my trust Kindle so that I can borrow books with the flick of a finger and never have to leave the comfort of my own home during reading sessions. My bed is obviously my favorite spot to read, especially at night, and it's even BETTER when it's raining!
    <p>I read books across all genres, but I love mystery since there is suspense every page I turn. Having something to read made any boring activity more exciting, whether it was waiting for a ride at Six Flgas or killing time before swim practice. Reading sparked my imagination and provided an escape from my everyday life. As for most of my life so far, my love of reading shapes my personality greatly.</p>

    <h4>My Cat</h4>
    <img src="images/cat.jpg" width="300" height="300">
    <p> Say hi to my cat Coco. If you're 90% of the population, he won't care. If you're lucky, he'll love you. Either way, he's grumpy and bossy.(but i still love him). He's black and white, and he's been with us for 2 years. He usually doesn't care about anyone except my dad. He is OBSESSED with my dad. He will follow him wherever and meow when he can't find him. Rarely will he bond with anyone in the household. Why??? Nobody knows.
    <p> My cat Coco SHOULD BE the ideal reading buddy but good luck getting him to snuggle with me- EVER. His meows outside my door are mostly for his enjoyment, because he loves teasing me. Coco seems to sense when I need his love on tough days BUT DOES NOT CARE AT ALL. However, I always laugh when he's playing with toys or chasing his own tail. Having him feels like a burden, but he is TRULY my best friend. (I don't think he thinks the same)</p>
    <h5> Technology</h5>
    <img src="images/technology.jpg" width="300" height="300">
    <p> Technology is my biggest passion. I am fascinated by the latest technology, and NEED to see how it works. Sometimes I take my PERSONAL Chromebook and deconstruct it to watch it work. My room has so many cables and probably combined processing power that I can't BEGIN to comprehend it. Building and tinkering with technology gives me a creative outlet unlike all else.
    <p> My love for technology extends far beyond just using devices - I want to understand how they work under the hood. I spend hours in chat rooms with others like me tinkering with devices inside out. Coding is a new passion as I learn to create my own simple programs and apps, like this website, :D. On the weekends, (when I'm not busy) you can find me on my personally built computer at home, gaming or tinkering. Technology opens a new world for me of creativity where my quick brain can flourish.</p>
