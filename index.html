    <h1> All About Me</h1> 
<h2> Swimming</h2>
<img src="images/swimming.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<p> I am a swimmer and have been for multiple years. Though I do not do competitive swimming, I still have fun and swim frequently. I also have a pool in my backyard for casual swimming during the summer months. I don't really love swimming, but it is a good sport to be in and I find that it is likable. I have been swimming since I was 6, and have come a long way from where I began. 
    <p>Even though I had to move to Texas, I have continued to be a frequent swimmer and have even increased my time per week swimming as the months go by and I gain endurance. Swimming has always been a small hobby of mine, that I can engage in even when I'm down. I don't have to think about anything, I can just swim. This makes it perfect for times when I don't feel like doing anything. Maybe someday I'll get a scholarship for swimming. Who knows? </p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p> Reading is one of my biggest passions as an 8th grader. I love getting lost in books and exploring new worlds through stories. Whenever I had free time, you could find me with my nose buried in a novel. My bed is obviously my favorite spot to read, especially at night, and it's even BETTER when it's raining!
    <p>I read books across all genres, but I love mystery since there is suspense every page I turn. Having a book to read made any mundane activity more exciting, whether it was waiting for a ride or killing time before swim practice. Reading sparked my imagination and provided an escape from my everyday life. As an 8th grader, my love of reading shapes my personality and views on the world.</p>

    <h4>My Cat</h4>

    <p>Coco is my beloved black and white cat who brightens every day. He greets me at the door after school, meowing for pets and treats. Though just a tiny feline, Coco has a big personality that fills our home with energy. His sleek black and white coat looks so striking in the sunlight that streams through the windows. Coco loves lounging in those warm rays and batting at any dust particles dancing in the beams. 
    <p> My cat Coco is the ideal reading buddy and snuggles up beside me whenever I open a book. His deep comforting purrs provide a calming backdrop as I get lost in the pages. Coco seems to sense when I need his reassuring presence on tough days. He never fails to make me laugh with his silly antics like chasing his own tail. Having Coco as my furry companion provides so much comfort and joy as I navigate 8th grade. He is truly my best friend.</p>
    <h5> Technology</h5>

    <p> Technology is my biggest passion. I am fascinated by the latest gadgets and gizmos, and how they can make our lives easier and more connected. Anytime I have spare cash from allowance or odd jobs, I save up to buy a new device or accessory. My room is a tech lover's dream, filled with computers, gaming systems, and more cables than I could count. Building and tinkering with technology gives me a creative outlet unlike anything else.
    <p> My love for technology extends far beyond just using devices - I want to understand how they work under the hood. I spend hours researching the inner workings of my favorite products online. Coding is a new passion as I learn to create my own simple programs and apps. On the weekends, you can often find me at the public library reading books about software development and computer engineering. Technology opens up an exciting new world of possibilities for me.</p>
